Applescript
============

Forked from [unforswearing applescript](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript)

This repository serves as a collection of Applescript snippets that can be used individually or part of a larger project. Many of these snippets were written as I was learning to use Applescript, and may not represent the best method of undertaking a particular task. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find that any of these files do not work for you. 

Copies of this repository exist at [Github](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript ) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/unforswearing/applescript).

## Links/Dependencies

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, here is [a different way](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/1459), and if you're on 10.8+ [you can go ahead and use this command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html). Both work via ```do shell script```.)
- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.
- <s>`Youtube-Post.scpt` requires [GoogleCL](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/), which is also useful for blogger, google calendar, and contacts</s>
  - GoogleCL is sadly defunct. Any associated scripts remain for posterity.
- I have also created [a few Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing?s=applescript) for more specific applescript/bash related tasks.
- Also, check out my [Alfred Workflows](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows), including [dued](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued), which may be my favorite creation.
